                    <p>﻿Officer of the Buenos Aires was discriminated against and punished for calling for the transfer to be close
Posted by policialesahora 01-06-2016 on security reviews (0)
"It was wrong of career by having a disabled daughter with down syndrome", a head of the police of Buenos Aires told an official subayudante that despite orders avoid that they relocate it as did when she has a drink with health problems.
The official sub Assistant Daiana Rodríguez and his daughter Soraya were victims of one of the most cruel acts which can be committed not only a police Chief, but any human being when it comes to not having account issues vital to be able to continue raising a son.
Rodriguez worked in the party of San Martín, but after suffering a chickenpox and returning to their you tasks, he encountered the unpleasant surprise that had moved it to the District of Tres de Febrero, so was forced to say to the departmental heads who not could move far from home, since the new destination demanded you two-hour trip from ida and two back and her small daughter Soraya had be relatively close to her mother, because she has many health problems, including respiratory and heart. However, anything imported to the heads of San Martin and reached the transfer.
Arriving at Tres de Febrero, she decided to file a brief asking that they transferred it again to an area close to his home, but the second head of the departmental Tres de Febrero, Deputy Superintendent Arnaldo Sroka replied: "It was wrong of career by having a disabled daughter with down syndrome", did not accept the letter requesting the transfer and above sanctioned it.
The official sub Assistant Rodriguez broke down and burst into tears before ssemejante injustice and lack of human condition of this and other leaders.
"Expressed all that my daughter has down syndrome and I need to be close because more than once while service called me so that it will look for and I need to be close. In the event that is sick leave it with a relative, but if you experience complications have to be close to assist the"Daiana told the blog police now.
In addition, explained: "I have No car to go and Tres de Febrero me is super far away, all I ask is a destination close to my house, either in San Martin anyone else who stayed close. Make it clear that it is not that I am infatuated to San Martín, am willing to any destination and want to meet and work. I don't want any benefit only the proximity to my daughter".
Still unanswered by the urgent request that did, this officer meets the penalty imposed by the second head of Tres de Febrero, Deputy Superintendent Sroka.
