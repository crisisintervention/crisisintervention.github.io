There are many harmful behaviors promoted by the society, such as the consumption of liquor, the abuse of fats and sugars, the consumption of tobacco, but also they are those (neurotic) chronic unhealthy behaviours who graciously say that they have bad character when in reality is a disease, that upset them, upsets, scares, suffers, in other words contaminate them and contaminana others.
A SMILE IS IMPORTANT...
OUR OLD AGE DEPENDS ON HOW FIND LIVED LIFE DURING OUR CHILDHOOD, YOUTH, AND ADULTS.

WITH THAT PURPOSE THE GERIATRIC HOSPITAL CARRIES OUT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS EXHIBITIONS, PHOTOGRAPHIC, PARADES, MARCHES, MASSES AND HEALTH CAMPAIGNS.
HEALTH IS MORE THAN NOT BEING ILL (A), HEALTH IS O.K., FEELING STRONG, FEELING HAPPY (A) OF BE LIVE, BE CHEERFUL, POSITIVE THINKING, FEEL POSITIVELY AND ACT POSITIVELY IN ONE DIRECTION BUILDING A BEHAVIOR COHERENT AND SOLIDARITY, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE FRIENDSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP OF OUR GERIATRIC CLUB MEMBERS.
