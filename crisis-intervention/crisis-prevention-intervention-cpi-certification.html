In the film you can see a very present model for a long time, which is: the biomedical model. "This consists in the study and treatment of diseases, considering these as independent of the patients own entities, i.e. that it regards the human body as an anatomical structure with morphological and functional aspects to the disease as a morphological lesion and / functional, finally the doctor as the technical professional repairing it".
It is displayed in the treatment that the doctor gives the patient with cancer, when they reviewed it, while speaking with her, such as ignore it and treat it as only as an object of study. And the biopsychosocial only shown when the nurse begins to worry about it and make it more care with a better deal.
One can say that its objective is to cure disease with a precise diagnosis and correct treatment based on the evidence, in an effective and efficient manner. It also considers that the problems of mental health, are due to disorders in physical and chemical mechanisms. The investigation of the causes of the disease and therapeutic procedures focuses on the "evidence material evidence" forgetting the complex reality of the human being.
Concluding is the model in which currently concentrates the majority of doctors because they worry about curing disease and not the patient, which makes lose ethics and morality to the patients. Given that you are not trying to an object, but an upright person who feels, thinks and reasons. I think that all simply human beings deserve respect and decent treatment.
For me the biopsychosocial model is better because it presents satisfaction of the people with health services. In 1977, Engel poses in the person the social context where live the patient, psychological characteristics, interact and biological.
