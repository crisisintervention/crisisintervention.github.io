                    <p>﻿Introduction to Mental health by MaLuisa
I will describe my personality in base ten different authors:
1. Hippocrates: According to this author myself with a blood personality because I am a person with a mood very variable, sensitive, flexible, warm, intuitive and gladly also melancholy because I'm thoughtful, dreamy, introverted, emotional, perfectionist and analyst.
2. Galen: I think I have an introverted, rational and emotional personality.
3 Freud: I think that it is a combination of oral, anal and falica because I am a meticulous person humble, shy, painful, cheerful, elegant, orderly, punctual, accurate, a little desordenad, optimistic and passive.
4 Hans Eysenk: I am extrovertido-sanguineo I am sociable, tolerant, vigorous and leading. Introvertido-flematico because I am calm, reliable, peaceful, meditative, careful and passive. Finally introvertido-melancolico because I'm quiet, reserved and sensible.
5 Raymond Catell: I have both, I am sociable because I'm emotionally stable, intelligent, assertive, strong, imaginative, experimental and casual awareness. And reserved because I am sensible, humble, shy, affectionate, practical, franca and "self-sufficient".
6 Erich Fromm: my personality is with productive orientation: themselves and others are valued for who they are. They use their potentials in productively and relate the world perceiving it accurately and creatively enriching it. They use humanistic ethics rather than authority.
7 Carl Jung: I'm outgoing with a predominance of sentiment: sociable, they seek harmony with the world, they respect the traditions and the authority; they tend to be emotional (expressive). Extrovert with a predominance of intuition: creative, innovative ideas. Introvert with a predominance of thought: like the privacy; they tend to be theoretical and intellectual. Introvert with a predominance of sentiment: thoughtful, quiet and hypersensitive. Introvert with a predominance of feeling: passive and calm. Also an introvert with a predominance of intuition: they tend to be dreamers, propose new ideas and are not generally understood by others.
8. Kretschmer: I am pinic and astenico because I'm warm, good-humored though variable, reserved, hypersensitive, cold and distant.
9 David Liberman: I am an Atemorizada person and Dudiza: people eager to participate but at the same time fear and shyness in front of others, are very nervous what generates oblivion in its responsibility and is fully responsible for a complete rout cient. But when entering in confidence is comfortable cient and acts naturally. Logical person: people are very demanding, no detail does not escape them. Once proposed something carried it out. Looking for the logical way to convey their thoughts and find it difficult to show their feelings and emotions. Observant person not involved: is a person who observes everything and everyone, costs it to participate, speak, think, and form part of the group. It has a great imagination, and writing is much more easy to talk. Also is reflexive, because you are looking for unknowns and creates no failure, everything you are interested in and all investigates.
10 Heyman-Le Senne: according to them I am in terms of emotions: emotional because I have great sensitivity and react in affective way shaped intense and alive. The activity I am active because I have an intimate need to act. And resonance have both primary and secondary because I reacted quickly but I also forget quickly, more open to the data of the current situation. I live the world of the present, the impression of the moment, I renew constantly, I reconciled easily, I have persistence of the past experiences about the present, difficult to console, emotionally constant and punctual.
A human conflict is a situation in which two individuals two groups of individuals with opposing interests come into confrontation, opposition undertake actions mutually neutralizing the of another individual's group, with the aim of damage, eliminate the rival party and achieve the objectives that led to this confrontation. Even when the dispute is Word (in this case is replaces the physical elimination by the pursuit of humiliation and shame of the opponent).
Conflicts in general are associated with something negative, since they loaded a series of hard-to-solve values and / intervene. But we see it from a positive perspective. Conflict deprives us the illusion that we control our lives. It implies the loss, separation, and the unwanted dependency. It requires us to develop skills and use resources that we didn't think that we had. The conflict pushes us beyond our limits. However, disrupts our dreams, shake our lives, us out of the nest, deprives us of comfort and forces us to stand on our own."
Self-esteem is the confidence in the efficacy of the own mind, the ability to think, make decisions of life and pursuit of happiness.
The personality takes shape from the first years of life, under the influence of the significant figures of childhood parental figures, in such a way that we subsequently make a pre-set and non-conscious way of life.
The influence of the significant figures in our children will develop a belief in ourselves and others, this belief that we have of ourselves will be our self-concept is going to manifest in our conduct. This self-concept will determine the degree of assessment which we ourselves, that is our level of self-esteem.
The coping is any activity that the individual can get underway, both cognitive and behavioral type, in order to deal with a particular situation.
Resilience is the ability of successful adaptation to the individual who has been exposed to biological factors of risk stressful life events; It also implies the expectation of continuing low susceptibility to future stressors. That is to say that it is the human capacity to overcome periods of emotional pain, problems and adversity; It may be even strengthened by these adversities.</p>
