                    <p>﻿Influence of advertising on food disorders.
Written by psikolokospucp on 22-11-2009 in General comments (4)
Since we live in a society that is worth more the outward beauty that the interior has increased, according to statistics, the number of people with eating disorders.
Many are identified currently, eating disorders that affect thousands of people. Sadorexia, the ortodexia, the vigorexia itself are some of the most important. Then a small definition of these will be.
 The sadorexia is colloquially called the diet of pain, it is a food disorder that combines the anorexia with sadism masochism (which is defined as the pleasure of the pain itself) with the permanent combination of anorexic behavior with innovative techniques of thinning of severe masochism.
 The ortodexia defined by experts as the pathological obsession with healthy eating. The main concern of the ortorexicos is not the amount of food you take, but its quality, to the point that "prefer not to eat anything before that ingested a product that is considered impure that it goes against their ideals".
Anorexia appears when there is a significant loss of weight caused by the modification of the various and different eating habits, and caused ultimately by the fear of fat. The risk is approx. Age 12, although it usually affects people between 14 and 18 years, being the most numerous, the girls however has been increasing the number of men who end up falling into this disease. As well, statistics show that 6% of young people between 12 and 21 years suffers from eating disorders being 90% cases of women.
The more likely are people who have a lack of self-esteem, which are perfectionists; believe to be most happy and successful if they were thinner as advertising induces it.
People who suffer from it, because they have a fear to bloat, which causes that they have a continuous control of the calories of meals, avoiding at all costs which contain many removing them and thus developing bulimia.
Bulimia: here the patient not tries to avoid the food, if there is no big binge eating. After these, the patient feels guilt and causes vomiting excessive exercises as compensation to the food intake. As in anorexia, this behavior is hidden and refuses, so diagnosis is difficult. In addition to the aggravation of vomiting excessive exercise, can also find other attitudes as intake of laxatives, chronic irritation of the throat, fatigue and muscle pain and unexplained dental problems. It is also too rigorous behaviour aimed at success.
Shall deal with advertising anorexia and bulimia:
First of all, beauty is a learned concept and the cultural norm of beauty changes over time
The media, advertising and the diet industry tend to set standards of beauty in today's society. We must remember that all they do this with the sole purpose of making money using our bodies and our perceptions as a means to achieve this. A clear example of this is the Fanta commercial light that shows how a thin girl can escape from the person who pursues it. This commercial, not just show suggests taking Fanta not you engordarás that displays as ideal a thin woman. ? v = K3-dya3GWw (Fanta commercial link)
Another example, as a blog of food illnesses, shown below.
Myth: I want to see me as a magazine model
Truth: You may want to see you as a model, but it is important to understand that or the models in real life, do not resemble their photographs. There are many tricks that are used to improve a photo. Some techniques include digital retouching, lighten or darken areas is especially used in photography in black and white, especially to emphasize the musculature in the men. All types of techniques are used to lead us to think that there are people who are more perfect than others. Removed-
The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that people are looking for perfection in a world of imperfection, who want to achieve the impossible and that are capable of reaching even suicide if they are not accepted as they are. And advertising plays an important role within the decision making of how they want to be would equal to the thin models?
