                    <p>Is why Einstein, as well as the invitation to the examined life of Socrates, seems to call us to reason, to think, to feel, to analyze our stuff, and then, once covered this process, discovered after our richness and depth, choose that lifestyle and interact that make life as simple as possible. "We believe that the aspiration to live the life of the simplest" is living with their backs to the human condition, without reason, without thinking, without feeling, without approaches, without examination, without complication and therefore without depth or wealth, and this impoverishment in terms of mental health, involves a wide range of symptoms, than not to dwell on it , we provide some examples: sad, empty feeling, decay lack of illusion and vital passion.
From the point of view of the psychotherapist, often want to remove conflicts from the person who comes to consultation with too quickly, sometimes creating an effect not always favorable, as the resolution of conflicts and the same times the patient, marks them, sometimes to drop weight, you need to want to discover that will later embrace once dropped the weight that has accompanied it maybe for a long time the vital process. "Is the duty of the Mental health professionals, help patients to think - is in a different way, to analyze things from another point of view new and healthy, to afford pleasure where formerly reigned the uneasiness to the conflict, to discover their own goals and all this, is not possible to do it the easy way". This conquest is arduous, is laborious, is a road as well as exciting, complicated because at the end of it, it appears that live in the simplest way possible, i.e. without weights and conflicts that prevented it and with the emergence of strategies personal to face new conflicts that arise.</p>
