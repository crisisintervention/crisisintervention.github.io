Posted by policialesahora 21-04-2015 in police comments (0)
A particular fact occurred Monday in the Buenos Aires Villa Luro neighborhood, where a "poliladron" and an accomplice were arrested while committing a "entradera", but the oddest thing was that this Federal police agent was license and raided a House which is in the jurisdiction of the Commissioner 40th, where this uniformed served.
Police sources revealed to the blog PolicialesAhora that the police who "went from camp" is the agent Walter Marcelo Plaza, 24 years old, who being detainee ordered automatically turn to passive service in the force, the previous instance to be exonerated, while it intervened the Superintendency of Internal Affairs of the Federal. Meanwhile, the other offender was identified as Cesar Acorn, 27, they added the research.
Everything began in the morning at a house in the Homer Street to the 300, far 40th Commissioner staff moved by a call to 911 about a theft in the form "entradera".
The 27 year old assailant, seeing that reached the patrol tried to escape, but was quickly arrested and in their possession were abducted a Browning pistol.
At that time, the soldiers noted that another subject closed the door on vigorously and tried to escape through the back, so the soldiers who were at the gate asked for support, and who were unaware of the number of offenders who might be inside that home.
It was so arriving mobiles surrounded the entire block and seeing the subject escaped by funds arrested him at the height of the Euclid passage to the 4800.
However, the police officers of the sectional 40th took a big surprise to see that it was a companion of the assaulter in question and it would not accomplish its task in the Federal because he was on annual leave.
This "poliladron" while doing their task as effective of that branch "had served of fixed stop from Monday to Friday from 9:00 to 15:00, in the area of the district.
Instead, the soldiers abducted other two pistols, an assigned agent Bersa and a Bersa pistol 9 mm, a blue vest with yellow letters with registration Argentina Federal Police, two sets of seals, packing tape, a credential of cash, a social work license, a chest plate and a Fiat Fiorino van.
According to designated by witnesses, criminals entered the home the impersonating officials from the AFIP, since in that home runs a textile workshop.
