Each person responds differently which may vary during the day.
The most common reactions:
-guilt
-insulation
-positive emotional States
All these reactions are normal and relatives and close people should support and understand each of them.
Normal is that we do not know what to do sitenemos a person that have diagnosed you the disease, we are filled with helplessness and often forces us to distance ourselves to not suffer that impotence.
Recommendations for someone who has the disease to family friends:
1. the acceptance of the disease, things are not at times as they would like us to be. It is much better to accept that he has cancer has been to be able to take it and continue with our vital goals.
2 focus on activities of enjoyment and
physical and emotional recovery. During and after the treatment activities are much diminished altered, therefore they must be focus on activities to enjoy and regain physical form, make them one by one enjoying the positive each time. In this period there is time for himself to family and friends.
