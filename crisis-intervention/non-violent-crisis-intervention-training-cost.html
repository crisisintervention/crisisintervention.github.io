9.1. THE AUSTRIASDEL 17TH CENTURY. VALID GOVERNMENT AND INTERNAL CONFLICTS.
The successors of Felipe II dejaronel power in the hands of people of their confidence, known as valid most of the valid tried to rule aside from councils, through reduced boards integrated by loyal people, and some utilizaronsu position to enrich themselves and help their families. The lawyers of losConsejos and the nobility of the Court led the opposition to losvalidos.
Philip III inaugurated elrecurso to the valid with the corrupt Duke of Lerma, who defended anti-war unapolitica in part motivated by the economic crisis. In the end, after having summary trial, was replaced by his son the Duke deUceda.
The main internal conflict was laexpulsion of the moriscos (1609), popular as it was intended to avoid losing the Moorish Alliance with the Turks with the pirates satisfied them, Aragonese and Valencian nobles received the goods give them expelled Moors 270,000.
Philip IV tuvocomo earned the ambitious and capable count-Duke of Olivares, but supolitica international to put an end to the revolt of the Bajosiniciada countries with Felipe II and return to Spain its range of main potenciaeuropea, led him to exhaustion and the profound crisis of 1640. After sufracaso, he was replaced by the more balanced and realistic Luis de Haro, Marquis of Carpio and susobrino.
The monarchy of Felipe IV had to deal with them protests to the project of Union of arms of the Duke (1625), the Guerrade thirty years, the independence of Portugal and the intentosindependentistas of Catalonia, Andalusia, Aragon, Navarre, Naples and Sicily, motivadospor strong fiscal pressure and destabilizing efforts driven desdeFrancia.
Charles II tuvovarios valid, as the father Nithard, the upstart Fernando de Valenzuela, suhermanastro don Juan José de Austria, the Duke of Medinaceli, count deOropesa and a little competent final clique.
The main internal problems come from losmomentos of lawlessness during the valimientos of stockbrokers and Valenzuela, peasant lasrevueltas and the bad economic situation caused by the continuasguerras promoted by France against Spain.
