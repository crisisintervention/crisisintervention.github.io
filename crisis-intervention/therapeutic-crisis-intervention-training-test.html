Floods are kept in several sectors of the province of Buenos Aires, since low the water very slowly, but in the midst of so much sadness for material losses, there was a touching story which has as heroes to two officers of the police of Buenos Aires in Dolores.
All occurred on Wednesday when troops Yesica Araya and Carlos Abel Aristegui, command of Rural Patrol (CPR) of Dolores, roamed the area, which still remained affected by floods and at one point heard the cries of desperation of three puppies.
Then, both uniformed did not hesitate and got into the water to search for those dogs which saw in the channel area and in a place that no could escape because they were in the midst of the mass of water resisting, wet, frightened and awaiting certain death.
However, Araya Aristegui got into the area, rescued three puppies and thus became the heroes of the Dolores community and today those puppies are with life waiting to be adopted, although there are many people interested in bringing them to their homes.
The image of both police viralizó on social networks and in all cases earned praise and congratulations of all the netizens, as well as throughout the game of Sorrows, which still struggles to recover from the floods, and this was a caress the soul.
