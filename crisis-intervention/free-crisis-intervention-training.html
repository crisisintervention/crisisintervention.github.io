                    <p>﻿Police Cumbia
Written by policialesahora 16-01-2017 police reviews (0)
Since cumbia villera burst like fashion almost two decades ago, many of their songs always revolved around crime, teasing the policemen and up to the "heroic" hit to kill a uniformed.
"You're a button, I never saw a policeman as bitter as you," sang the Group flower stone bad reputation and Damas Gratis devoting issues to "cap", they were the best-known bands that "engaged" topics to the police.
However, this weekend was the revenge. A group of cumbia villera, called "Cumbia police" presented his subject "Don Vigi", which highlights the work done by the soldiers to catch criminals, of which mocks by their actions and their subsequent detention.
Vos que sos tanpiola and siemdpre you're robbing us the vigi walk patrukllando you get the polenta and you can not start because with us you want to kill
"Vos sos piola as caco, you jodés to society, it makes like 20 years to us we sing..." By the sidewalk in front you decided to walk and we are here the guards, Dad, if you engage in stealing, truck travelling... Then you in llorás and friends whenever they are poorly removed the tube and call us to the front stop... "We are human and we also like to sing, are blue, vigi, with the bad guys all evil", says part of the song that promises to make all the rage this summer in clubs on the coast, in Buenos Aires and throughout the interior of the country.
Now yes, policemen in their franc service enjoy a Party want to go dancing can enjoy singing the cumbia "Don Vigi" without having to get angry for so many autographs there throughout these years.
"During the 2016 have denounced the Smurf 'cumbia' on the grounds that demonstrations that were poured on it undermine the respect that it deserves both the cash and the police somehow." "Now a few days ago, he came to our ears the Cumbia Dion Vigi, and noblesse oblige also must weigh in on the subject", told the blog police now lawyer Diego Raidan, who was an officer of the police of Buenos Aires and is currently President and founder of the Group Privanza, which gives legal assistance and medical coverage to police officers in the province of Buenos Aires.
"From the humble place we occupy with Group Privanza we struggle to regain the respect they lost uniformed workers deserve long. Unlike the conventional wisdom in our society, we believe that not everything is the same. Therefore, and although there are substantial differences in the message of both subjects, must also recognise that the use of words of the same tenor do not help to achieve the long-sought differentiation. "Not only the uniform must differentiate an effective, also the use of vocabulary, the way of referring, attitudes, and because no, the way to have fun", closed.</p>
