Primary health care technicians are responsible for empowering people to increase control over their health, and to improve it. A group to achieve a proper physical, mental and social well-being, an individual must be able to identify and carry out a few aspirations, satisfy needs and change the environment adapt to it health is seen, as a resource for everyday life, not as the goal of life. Health is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources along with physical abilities. Therefore, the promotion of health is not simply the responsibility of the health sector, but it goes beyond healthy life-styles to well-being.
